Description: This package implememnts a Bayesian hierarchical model that represents 
    observations as aggregation of a few unobserved binary machines where the aggregation 
    varies by subjects. Our approach is to specify the model likelihood via factorization 
    into two latent binary matrices: machine profiles and individual factors. 
    Given latent factorization, we account for inherent errors in measurement using 
    sensitivities and specificities of protein detection. 
    We use a prior for the individual factor matrix (Indian Buffet Process for binary matrices) to 
    encourage a small number of subject clusters each with distinct patterns of active machines. 
    The posterior distribution for the numbers of patient clusters and machines are 
    estimated from data and by design tend to concentrate on smaller values. 
    The posterior distributions of model parameters are estimated via Markov chain 
    Monte Carlo which makes a list of molecular machine profiles with uncertainty 
    quantification as well as patient-specific posterior probability of having each machine.
